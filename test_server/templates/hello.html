    <h1>The Pious Web</h1>

    <p>The Pious Web is an Internet experience that constantly reminds you of of God's omniscience.</p>
  
    <p>All of these features are implemented using Divine Intervention(c) at the ISP level, so it is independent of browser and operating system.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <h3>Jesus'd images</h3>
  
    <p>On the Pious Web, Jesus accompanies your images.</p>

    <h2>How you can help</h2>

    <h3>The Pious Web logo</h3>

    <p>The Pious Web needs a nice logo. It should be reverant of God's word.</p>

    <p>Also this web portal could be made a million times more beautiful.</p>

    <h3>(Soon) JavaScript plugin for extra hacking</h3>

    <p>Soon, each page will have an extra JavaScript file loaded into it for extra access in making a religious experience. Check out the code at <a href="https://github.com/boxysean/PiousWeb">github</a> and add your own JavaScript religious hacks.</p>

    <h3>Flushing out the image overlay feature</h3>

    <p>Buddy Jesus is cool, but I want a more religious experience. Perhaps a gradient mask fading to a really beautiful picture of Jesus.</p>
